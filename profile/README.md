## Github issues and suggestions

We encourage students to submit Github issues for issues, bugs and suggestions for improvements (follow [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/configuring-issues/quickstart) for a quick guide on how to submit an issue to a Github repository).

  - One issue per issue
  - Short and descriptive titles 🤏
  - Provide relevant screenshots, links and mentions
  - Describe why it needs to be solved
  - Be objective 🤓
  - Describe how to reproduce the error/bug 🐛
